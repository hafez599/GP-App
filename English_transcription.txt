[0.00 - 10.52]  Hello and welcome to the Los Poyos-Armanos family.
[10.52 - 13.32]  My name is Gustavo, but you can call me Gus.
[13.32 - 16.52]  I am thrilled that you'll be joining our team.
[16.52 - 22.28]  Each and every day we serve our customers exceptional food with impeccable service.
[22.28 - 24.96]  We take pride in everything that we do.
[24.96 - 31.24]  And after this 10-week online seminar, I am confident that you'll fit right in.
[31.24 - 34.72]  I like to think I see things in people.
[34.72 - 39.72]  To begin, I'd like to talk about the cornerstone of the Los Poyos-Armanos brand.
[39.72 - 40.72]  Communication.
[40.72 - 46.24]  As an employee of Los Poyos-Armanos, you set the tone for the entire dining experience.
[46.24 - 50.68]  Be mindful of what your words and behavior communicate to our guests.
[50.68 - 52.40]  Always be aware of your posture.
[52.40 - 53.96]  Remember to stand up straight.
[53.96 - 57.24]  Your customers and your back will thank you for it.
[57.24 - 59.56]  Put effort into your appearance.
[59.56 - 63.40]  All employees are required to dress appropriately.
[63.40 - 65.88]  Keep your uniform clean and pressed.
[65.88 - 69.64]  If you want respect, you must look respectable.
[69.64 - 71.16]  Speak in complete sentences.
[71.16 - 75.60]  We never use one-word greetings like hey or yeah.
[75.60 - 78.00]  Always make eye contact.
[78.00 - 82.16]  And finally, whether you're with a customer or not, remain composed.
[82.16 - 88.48]  Inside, you can be thinking about your homework or your friends or your side business.
[88.48 - 96.36]  But no one should ever know it because at Los Poyos-Armanos, someone is always watching.
[96.36 - 98.12]  So don't forget to smile.
[98.12 - 99.36]  That's all for today.
[99.36 - 102.76]  See you next time when we'll be discussing cleanliness.

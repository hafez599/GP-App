{"transcription":" Hello and welcome to the Los Poyos-Armanos family. My name is Gustavo, but you can call me Gus. I am thrilled that you'll be joining our team. Each and every day we serve our customers exceptional food with impeccable service. We take pride in everything that we do. And after this 10-week online seminar, I am confident that you'll fit right in. I like to think I see things in people. To begin, I'd like to talk about the cornerstone of the Los Poyos-Armanos brand. Communication. As an employee of Los Poyos-Armanos, you set the tone for the entire dining experience. Be mindful of what your words and behavior communicate to our guests. Always be aware of your posture. Remember to stand up straight. Your customers and your back will thank you for it. Put effort into your appearance. All employees are required to dress appropriately. Keep your uniform clean and pressed. If you want respect, you must look respectable. Speak in complete sentences. We never use one-word greetings like hey or yeah. Always make eye contact. And finally, whether you're with a customer or not, remain composed. Inside, you can be thinking about your homework or your friends or your side business. But no one should ever know it because at Los Poyos-Armanos, someone is always watching. So don't forget to smile. That's all for today. See you next time when we'll be discussing cleanliness."}

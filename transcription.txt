[0.0 - 5.36] Hey what's going on guys welcome back to another video. So this is a two hours long express crash
[5.36 - 10.64] course for beginners and in this video we will build a node express project from scratch. Let
[10.64 - 14.88] me show you the topics that we are going to build in this video. So we will first start with the
[14.88 - 19.92] express project setup and then we will move to how we can create an express server. We will
[19.92 - 24.64] also see how we can install the thunder client to test our apis. Then we will set up the
[24.64 - 29.68] express router and after that we will see that how we can handle error in express and using
[29.68 - 34.72] the async handler. Then we are going to see how we can set up the express middleware for our project.
[34.72 - 39.76] After that we will have the mongo dv setup and then we will learn how we can use mongo's schema in
[39.76 - 44.8] order to communicate with our database. Then we will see how we can have the prod api in our
[44.8 - 49.2] project. Next topic that we will cover is the user authentication. We will see how we can
[49.2 - 53.76] authenticate our users and we will have the registration and the login endpoints. Then
[53.76 - 58.32] we will see how we can have the controllers which will help us to communicate with our database
[58.32 - 63.04] for different operations. Then we will see how we can do the password hashing and then
[63.04 - 68.64] compare the hash password with the raw password. Then we will also use the JWT token. So we are
[68.64 - 74.32] going to have the sign in and verify of the JWT token for the authentication part. Then we will
[74.32 - 79.6] see how we can handle the relationship using mongo's schema for our different documents in our
[79.6 - 84.48] mongo dv. Then we are going to see how we can do the protected routes. So on the authenticated
[84.48 - 89.44] user we will be able to access those routes. Next we are going to have the user authorization
[89.44 - 94.48] so that only authorized user should be able to access our endpoints. And after that in the end
[94.48 - 99.2] we are going to see the api testing. So how we are going to test our api and the project.
[99.2 - 103.04] You can also find the detail timestamp in the description of the video so that you
[103.04 - 107.6] can jump to any topic directly. So if this sounds interesting then stick around. Also don't
[107.6 - 111.6] forget to subscribe the channel and press the bell icon so that you don't miss the videos like
[111.6 - 113.28] this one. So let's get started.
[120.4 - 124.96] All right guys so in this video we are going to build a contact manager application
[124.96 - 129.76] and we are going to build the apis of how we can manage the contacts. We are also going to
[129.76 - 134.8] introduce the authentication and authorization concept in order to build this application.
[134.8 - 140.0] So before we go deep dive I want to give you some overview on the RESTful API conventions
[140.0 - 144.96] because we are going to build the REST APIs. So this is the RESTful API conventions where you will
[144.96 - 150.8] see that we have the CRUD actions. And first what we will do is we will simply going to build a CRUD
[150.8 - 156.56] API for the contacts and contacts will be our resource. So we will have different CRUD actions
[156.56 - 162.96] like get all contacts, get a single contact, create contact, update contact and delete contact.
[162.96 - 168.24] For that we are going to use the HTTP methods as get, put, post and delete. And on the extreme
[168.24 - 174.08] right we will see the end points so we are having a slash api slash contacts. And for the other one we
[174.08 - 180.64] have the api contacts slash id. So we will have to pass the id in order to get an individual contact
[180.64 - 185.44] or update a contact or delete a contact. And to start with this application we need to install
[185.44 - 190.88] the Node.js in our machine. So I already have the Node.js installed in my machine and if
[190.88 - 195.84] you want to install it then you can go to the official documentation of Node.js and then you
[195.84 - 200.4] can simply install the current version or the recommended version for the most users.
[200.4 - 203.92] Now we will also need a visual studio code so you can download the visual studio code from
[203.92 - 208.8] the official documentation. Now let's jump to the visual studio code and here what we are going to
[208.8 - 214.16] do is first we are going to set up our project. So let's go to the terminal and I'm going to open
[214.16 - 220.0] the terminal or write and then I'm going to go to my documents directory. So let's go to the
[220.0 - 222.32] documents and inside the documents directory I'm
[222.88 - 226.16] And here I am going to create a new directory which will be
